Tom Write Editor v0.3beta

If like me you find that the proposed standard textarea texpattern is too small to write, here is a writing space in full screen for the body of your articles.

It uses [Ace editor](http://ace.ajax.org/#nav=about)

By default a basic Syntax Highlighter for textile in activate.
